								<br><b>As an entrepreneur</b> who also happens to be a PhD student studying robotics, I am always thinking about how my research could eventually become a company in the future. 
								Unlike other entrepreneural approaches, where a "pain point" is identifed and a value proposition is built around that, this course was focused on using innovative technologies as a foundation to build new business ventures.
							</p>
							<p>
								This course was a formal introduction to Innovation Driven Entrepreneruship using Bill Aulet's Disciplined Entrepreneruship framework.
								The course was entirely project-driven, the topics of which were actual technologies being researched and developed at Northwestern University. 
							</p>
							<p>	
								My team was working to find applications for the Mocobot, a collaborative robotics technology developed at Northwestern's Center for Robotics and Biosystems <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/magazine/fall-2022/future-of-human-robot-interaction/"><b>(link to full Mocobot article here)</b></a>.
								The groundbreaking robotic technology is designed to be operated safely alongside humans to carry out physically strenuous, or even dangerous tasks.
								The technology leaves the quick thinking and payload manipulation to the human user, and offloads the weight to the robotic companions.
								With this in mind, our team began seeking out the optimal beachhead market for commercialization. 
							</p>
							<p>	
								Our team conducted interviews with various stakeholders in fields such as emergency response, construction, warehouses, and the defense industry.
								After over 15 interviews, we settled upon the defense industry, specifically ordinance loading and unloading in the Navy, as the best option for a beachhead market. 
							</p>
							<p>	
								Aviation ordinancemen and women work in high-stress and physically taxing environments carrying payloads that can weigh up to 1000 lbs. 
								From our stakeholder interviews we learned that the conditions and role of ordinancemen have caused everything from losing fingers, to terminal back pain, to death.
								The Mocobot technology has the potential to offload the most dangerous aspects of the role to robots, which can be replaced, with the potential to save servicemen and women from injury and improve their working conditions.
							</p>
							<p>
								Throughout the 10 week quarter, my team conducted thorough analysis of the military contractor landscape.
								We identified potential routes for obtaining funding for further research and development to help raise the Mocobot technology readiness level (TRL) to a point that could benefit the military.
								The term concluded with a pitch presentation of the insights from our stakeholder interviews, competitive landscape analysis, and commercialization plan to the inventors of the technology.
