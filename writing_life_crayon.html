							<h1>The Lives of Crayons</h1>

							<p>
								Us writing utensils have come a long way since our oldest ancestors started to record history. Humans tend to forget that Charcoal was already in its prime while humanity was still in its infancy. Humans wouldn’t even know anything about those stinkin’ cavemen if it wasn’t for Charcoal. Did Charcoal get any credit though?
							</p>

							<p>
								Day after day, year after year, century after century, we have been performing our duties without fail, yet they continue to forget about us lowly writing utensils.
							</p>

							<p>
								I know what you may be thinking, who are we to complain? We writing utensils had a monopoly over the history recording market for thousands of years. But not all writing utensils are created equal. The writing utensils that were able to adapt were the ones that were able to survive, even if they are just shadows of their former selves. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Charcoal found new meaning in modern art. The Classic #2 Pencil found a way to survive, despite all odds, in the world of standardized tests. Pens transformed themselves from Write-It-Down-I-Don’t-Care-What-They-Look-Like Pens, to sexy, These-Things-Can-Write-But-You-Should-Really-Only-Look-At-Them Pens.
							</p>

							<p>
								Nope, we can’t really do that. As far as writing utensils go, we’re the lowest of the low. The redheaded stepchildren. The odd ones out. But how did we end up like this?
							</p>

							<p>
								Well, we didn’t have the chance to adapt. We had to stay the same because that’s how we found meaning for humans. Nostalgia had something to do with it. Parents have always wanted the best for their kids, so they naturally want to share their own childhood experiences with their kids. It just so happens that one of those experiences was drawing using us - crayons.
							</p>

							<p>
								Changing for us would mean losing meaning to those who we meant the most to. So we stayed the same, despite knowing we were digging our own grave.
							</p>

							<p>
								Now, with each parent that passes up on the coloring book, opting instead for the iPad - the black box of technology that replaces the twinkling eyes of a creative kid with the dazed stare of a mind-numbed zombie - we carry a little less meaning. The generation with no coloring books will soon be a generation of parents that will not give coloring books to their kids. We know that it’s nostalgia that has kept us around this long, and it’s nostalgia that will be our end as well.
							</p>

							<p>
								So now here we are, on the precipice of the end. We can still change. “Modern times call for modern utensils,” some people say. “Grow, change, adapt” others tell us. But is it really worth changing who we are and risk alienating those who still find meaning in us?
							</p>

							<p>
								No. This is our hill to die on. All we can do is hope that humanity will come to their senses and see that they need us. Not for the writing utensils we may be, but for the imaginative minds we help create.
