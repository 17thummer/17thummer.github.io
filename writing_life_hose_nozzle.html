							<h1>The Life of a Hose Nozzle</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The mold pulled away from the outer edges of my exterior as my extreme heat created the mirage-like effect of looking across the scorching horizon of the desert at high noon. I immediately rolled down a small ramp, unable to stop. Then everything went dark. I could hear the sizzle of my hot metal body and feel the cold, dirty water quenching and hardening my exterior. Then the light came back. Vibrations bounced me up and down, left and right, knocking me into hundreds of other copies of myself. I thought, perhaps they are my family? I wondered, are they feeling the same thing as I am? A rush of wind washed over my body sending the last drops of water on my skin into the abyss below. Once more I began to fall, this time down a steep ramp into the unknown.</p>
							<p>My body landed righted. I quickly entered a carousel sending me around and around. With each rotation I could feel my body changing – parts being added one by one until the spinning stopped. I felt more… complete.</p>
							<p>I left my birthplace soon thereafter, unsure of what would come next, unable to understand my role in this world, my purpose.</p>
							<p>The days passed slowly on the way to what I thought was my final destination. I sat patiently in my spot, next to my kin traveling towards the unknown. I tried to prepare mentally for what was to come, but given the unpredictability of my situation, I knew this was merely a coping mechanism.</p>
							<p>Then we stopped. I was the first taken out. I thought maybe I was special for some reason. I was quickly transferred from one hand to another, then set down on the cold, dark, dusty surface of a shelf. My kin, who I had spent so much time with on the journey, were placed one by one in front me. Why was I at the back, in the dark, in the dust?</p>
							<p>The days began to blur together. I would see the lights turn on at the front. Then, some time later, they would turn off again. Occasionally, one of us would get removed from the front of the line, never to be seen again. After two or three of us would disappear, the line would be shifted up, towards the light. I could feel the energy in myself growing as I came closer to the front of the line, moving ever closer to my destiny in life.</p>
							<p>Then a gap developed between me and the one in front of me. I was forgotten. Soon thereafter, I saw the quick movement of hands that could only mean a new shipment of my kin. I was pushed back and back and back until I was right where I started who knows how long ago. This couldn’t be the meaning of life. I had so much more to offer than just a dust collector at the back of a dark store shelf.</p>
							<p>I sat for a long time. Unmoving. The shine of my body giving way to tarnish. I watched more of my kin come and go, until they too stopped coming. A new generation had begun to appear. A plastic generation.</p>
							<p>I could tell just from looking that this generation was cheaper. Easier to produce? Maybe. But were they of the same quality as me? I thought not. However, just like my kin before me, this new generation came and went while I sat collecting an ever-thicker layer of dust. I lost all hope.</p>
							<hr />
							<p>One day, the lights didn’t turn on. The doors didn’t open. Silence rang all around me. I truly was forgotten.</p>
							<hr />
							<p>The warmth of a wrinkled hand woke me up out of the silence-induced coma. The light hit my tarnished body for the first time since I had been placed on the shelf so long ago.</p>
							<p>“They don’t make them like this anymore.” Said the raspy, but soothing voice of whose hand I was being held in. “This is the only one I’ve ever seen in this condition.”</p>
							<p>Had I heard him correctly? Was I truly unique? I was one of many when I was born. For so long I had been overlooked; left in the dark while others were chosen ahead of me to fulfill their purpose. I had been led to believe that I meant nothing to anyone, until I started believing it myself.</p>
							<p>I felt again. I felt the smooth and cool polish as it removed the years of dust and tarnish from my exterior. I felt the sunlight reflecting in all directions off me. I felt important, more so even than the day I was born so long ago.</p>
							<p>The wrinkled hand set me down delicately. Another shelf. Only this time, on display.</p>
