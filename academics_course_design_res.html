							<h1>Design Research: Learning to See People and Their Patterns</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>
								I was first introduced to the concept of human centered design (HCD) during my time at Union College for my undergraduate degree, and I quickly embraced it.
								This ultimately led to the founding of Entrepreneurs of the Nott (EON for short), Union’s first club focused on entrepreneurship and HCD. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Fast forward to today and I am still just as interested in HCD (hence why I took this class to begin with!).
								However, one qualm that I have with design education, which understandably focuses on project based courses and intends to teach all aspects of the design process, is that the project can feel rushed.
								Oftentimes, and especially at universities on the quarter system like Northwestern, within the first week of the class you have to form teams, identify a problem or pain point, and have all of your research done prior to the second class.
								A WEEK!
								If there is anything that I have learned about design, it’s that rushing any part of the process typically leads to poor designs.
							</p>
							<p>
								That is precisely why I found this class to be such a valuable learning experience.
								Rather than try to rush through the entire design process, we were able to spend 10 focused weeks on the early phases of HCD, namely Framing, Research, and Synthesis, on a project of our choosing. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Being a graduate student, I am keenly aware of the mental health issues that can affect graduate students at various times throughout their studies.
								I conducted research interviews with my peers from different backgrounds, academic disciplines, and at all stages of their academic careers to better understand how people experience mental health - the root causes, how to address them, and how the university may or may not support them along the way.
							</p>
							<p>
								<a href="attachments\DSGN_research_final_presentation.pdf"><b>My final presentation can be found here</b></a>.
								The presentation outlines my overarching research question, the research approach, and the concepts that arose as a result of my insights.
								Just to reiterate, the main focus of this course was the research and deeply understanding the problem, with concept designs as a final step, and no implementation.
